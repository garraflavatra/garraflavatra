I'm currently working on Rolens: an open source MongoDB client for all desktop platforms. It's fast!

[Star it on GitHub](https://github.com/garraflavatra/rolens) | [Download the latest release](https://github.com/garraflavatra/rolens/releases/latest)

I also maintain a few other open source projects, like [Alphabets](https://github.com/garraflavatra/alphabets) and [trmclr](https://github.com/garraflavatra/trmclr).
