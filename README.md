I'm currently working on Rolens: an open source MongoDB client for all desktop platforms. It's fast! [Star it on GitHub](https://github.com/garraflavatra/rolens) or [download the latest release](https://github.com/garraflavatra/rolens/releases/latest).

I also maintain a few other open source projects, like [Alphabets](https://github.com/garraflavatra/alphabets) and [yeslint!](https://github.com/garraflavatra/yeslint).
